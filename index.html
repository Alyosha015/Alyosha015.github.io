            <h1>StormTools</h1>
            Using my questionable JavaScript ability and inspiration from <a href="https://mrlennyn.github.io/">MrLennyn's Website</a>, I've made this to have versions of my stormworks tools available to use, since releasing a bunch of exe's seemed excessive.<br>
            <br>
            For now I've only added my image to paintblock converter and vehicle weatherer, but could add more in the future. <br>
