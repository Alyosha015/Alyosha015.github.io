            In Stormworks, weathering generally is when faces are painted with random slight variations in the colors to make them appear weathered. With this tool you pick a specfic color on the vehicle to weather, and the amount of colors to weather with.

            <h2>Tutorial</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Click <b>Select File</b> and select file of the vehicle you want to weather. Vehicles files are stored in <b>%AppData%\Stormworks\data\vehicles\</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Enter the rgb values of the color on your vehicle you want to be weathered in the <b>Color To Weather</b> text box. They have to be entered with spaces inbetween, for example <b>234 124 86</b>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Set how many colors should be used to weather by changing the <b># of Colors</b> number input. (This includes the original color, for example if set it to 4, 3 extra colors would be used).
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you want the amount of blocks to be weathere to be lower, decrease the <b>% to Weather</b> number input. It controls what percentage of the faces have their color modified.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Click <b>Generate XML</b>, and the vehicle file will be generated and downloaded. Copy if from your downloads folder to the stormworks vehicle folder: <b>%AppData%\Stormworks\data\vehicles\</b>. (One way to reach the folder is to press Windows+R to open Run, then paste the path in and press enter).
                </li>
                <li>
                    I found that try to weather using automatically generated similar colors didn't turn out well, so the colors used to weather are only meant to be placeholders and are randomly generated, but make it easy to see the colors when using replace color in the editor. So for the last step, you have to change the colors to the ones you want.
